[KO3: Swamp Dome Kickoff Table]
11: Hooligans! The game is held up by a riot as the players take cover in the dugouts, but the referee chooses not to stop the clock. Roll a d3, each team moves their Turn counter this many spaces along the Turn track. If this takes the number of turns to 8 or more for both teams, then the half ends.
12: Sack the Ref! The fans decide the referee has been bought and exact vengeance! His replacement is so intimidated that for the rest of the half all attempts to argue the call succeed on a 2+ roll so long as the team still has a head coach.
13: Rogue Alligator!: A hungry gator has found his way onto the pitch and decides to make a meal out of a player, Each coach rolls two dice and adds the number of team re-rolls they currently have; a player on the low rollers  team has been caught by the gator. A tie means that both teams are affected. Decide randomly which player in the other team was bit and place that player in the Injured box right away. The player is counted as being Badly Hurt, but is not counted as a casualty for either team. No Armor roll is required. 
14: Instinctive Defense: The kicking teams coach may reorganize his players; in other words he can set them up again. The receiving team must remain in the set-up chosen by their coach.
15: Instinctive Defense: The kicking teams coach may reorganize his players; in other words he can set them up again. The receiving team must remain in the set-up chosen by their coach.
16: Terrace Brawl: Rival supporter groups decide to punch it up in the terraces. Each coach rolls 1d6 and adds their fan factor, the loser's Fan Factor is reduced by the result of a d6 roll for the remainder of the match. In the event of a tie, re-roll.
21: Roaring Fans: Each coach rolls a dice and adds their teams fan factor and their number of cheerleaders to the score. Re-roll any ties. The side with the highest score is inspired by their fans cheering and gets an extra re-roll this half.

23: Woops! The player nearest the spot of the ball (in the case of multiple players equally close, the kicking player may pick one) slips in a patch of mud while attempting to receive the kickoff and is stunned.
24: Poor Kick: The ball scatters a number of squares equal to the roll of two dice on the kick-off, instead of only one dice.
25: Poor Kick: The ball scatters a number of squares equal to the roll of two dice on the kick-off, instead of only one dice.
26: Raining Frogs: A goblin shaman in the stands with a debt to a bookmaker is trying to affect the outcome of the game by forcing the under with a rainstorm, but can't quite get the spell right. Both teams take cover in the dugouts until the amphibian deluge ends. Clear the pitch and set up for the kickoff again, as though a TD had just been scored.

52: Hard Count: The offense start their drive a fraction before the defense are ready, catching the kicking team flat-footed. All of the players on the receiving team are allowed to move one square. This is a free move and may be made into any adjacent empty square, ignoring tackle zones. It may be used to enter the opposing half of the field.
53: The Chuck! Goblin fans are famous for showing their support by getting together and tossing one of their number as high as possible above the crowd over and over. While this demonstration of team bravado certainly gets the crowd worked up, it really never ends well for the little guys getting chucked. Both teams roll a d6 and add their fan factor and the number of cheerleaders they have, re-rolling any ties. The winner is so motivated by the reckless show of support that it gains a bonus Team Re-roll for this half.
54: Out Coached: Each coach rolls a dice and adds the number of assistant coaches in their team to the score. Re-roll any ties. The side with the highest score gets an extra re-roll this half thanks to the brilliant training provided by the coaching staff.
55: Pilfered Baggage: A group of thieves (most likely related to the stadium owners if rumors are true) has stolen the money boxes from one of the teams' buses during the game. Each team rolls 2d6 and adds the number of assistant coaches they have. The low rolling team loses 10,000gcs from their treasury immediately. If the rolls are tied, both teams are robbed. If the robbed team's treasury is empty, then there is no effect.
56: Corner Blitz! The kicking team gets a bonus team turn and may activate one player before the receiving team. The bonus turn does not count against the kicking teams turn limit for the half, so their coach does not have to move the Turn marker along a space, and he cannot be called for illegal procedure for failing to move the Turn marker. Note that only one player may be activated during this bonus turn.

{To use your own weather-table, use the same format as the Kickoff table.}
{I recommend you don't alter the original tables, but create new ones called KO2}
{and W2, and set pbembb.ini to use these instead of the standard ones.}
{The lines should be formatted as above: roll: TITLE. Description. All on 1 line.}
