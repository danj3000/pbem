=starting position.

=armor roll.
Custard Pie
=You may use this card at any time. Nominate one player on your team when you use the card. The player has cunningly 
=concealed a custard pie about his person, which he may throw at an opposing player. This counts as the player's action for

=over when he lands, make an armor roll for him as usual and he will drop the ball if he was carrying it. If the square is 
=occupied, then the occupier is pushed back and knocked over by the impact (if prone they are pushed back and must roll for 
=injury).

=Notes: The Trampoline can be in any square on your half of the pitch. Will cause a Turn Over if a player on the moving team 
=falls down.

=zone of one of your players. Your player sneakily trips the opposing player up while the ref's attention is diverted by the 
=kick-off. Place the opposing player prone, and make an armor roll to see if he is injured using the normal rules.
Sorry Sir!
=You may play this card when one of your players knocks an opposing player off the pitch. Rather than ending up in the crowd 
=the player luckily lands in his own dugout. Unluckily he lands on top of one of his own team's coaching staff, squashing him

=to see what happens to the victim: 1-2 = Badly shaken, they must miss the rest of the match, 3-4 = Seriously injured, miss 
=the rest of this match and the next one too! 5-6 = Dead, dead, dead!

=last kick-off. You have substituted the player for a cunningly built dummy packed with explosives! When the opposing player 
=makes the block the dummy explodes, knocking over the player making the block automatically, and knocking over other players 
=adjacent to the dummy on a roll of 4+. Make an armor roll for any player that is knocked over to see if they are injured as 
=normal. Remove the 'dummy' from the field and place it in the Reserves box to show that the real player has come out from 
=his hiding place.
=
=Notes: A player who has previously taken any action during the current drive cannot be the exploding player. This will cause 
=a Turn Over if a player on the moving team falls down.
Razzle Dazzle
=You may play this card at the start of any of your turns. You have been practicing a special play with your team. If it 
=works it should give you a sure touchdown. If it fails, you'll be in deep trouble! Roll a dice: On a roll of 1-2 the play 
=fails miserably and your turn ends imediately. ON a roll of 3-6 the play works brilliantly and the opposing team are so 
=confused that they may not do anything in their next turn!
=
=Notes: Since the roll happens at the start of the turn, you could use a team ReRoll to reroll this card.
Fake Play
=You may play this card when one of your players is about to throw the ball. He fakes a hand-off which fools the opposing 
=team into thinking he has given the ball away. Because the opposing team are all looking at the wrong player, they may not 
=try to intercept the ball when the player throws it.

=disgusting manner. Such is the blatancy of the foul that your player is automatically sent off by the referee. Roll below

=last (any turns that have been taken are lost though).
Spike!
=You can use this card when one of your players commits a foul on a player on the opposing team. The player runs up and 
=spikes the opposing player by diving at him head first! the opposing player is automatically injured, no armor roll is 
=necessary, and your player must be placed prone, and may be injured as normal. Do not roll to see if the referee spots the 
=foul and awards a penalty.

High Punt
=You may play this card when you kick off the ball. Work out where the ball will land as normal. However, the ball has been 
=kicked very high, and it will not land until the end of your team's first turn after the kick-off. The ball lands at the 
=very end of your turn, after you have made any and all actions with your players. If the ball lands out of bounds or in your 
=half, then the opposing team gets the touchback and may give the ball to any player in their team at the start of their 
=second turn.
=
=Notes: You must use this before rolling for the Kick Off result.
Assassin
=You may use this card at any time to make an assassination attempt on one opposing player. The assassin fires a poison dart 
=at the player, who collapses in agony. Place the victim prone and then make a roll on the Injury Table to see what has

=
=Notes: This card will cause a Turn Over if used against a player on the moving team.

=you players has been winding up an opponent. Nominate the player in you team and an opposing player in an adjacent square. 
=The opposing player attacks your player just as the ball is kicked. Work out this block as normal but don't count any 
=assists for either side. This is against the rules so, after the block is worked out, the referee sends the opposing player 
=off for the rest of the match, and the opposing team suffers a turnover.
=
=Notes: This penalty cannot be successfully argued, but some cards could negate the penalty.
Bribe The Ref #4
=You may play this card at any kick-off, before you have set up your team. You have bribed the referee to turn a blind eye so

=opposing coach may place the player in any square; 2 - 5 = A bit lost. Nominate a square and roll for scatter three times to

=gain a number of gold pieces equal to the roll of a dice x 10,000.
=
=Notes: This counts as a part of your winnings.
Bad Habits
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. The opposing team has picked up some very bad 
=habits and has its number of Team Re-rolls reduced by 1 permanently. The opposing coach must update his team roster 
=accordingly.
Bad Habits
==
Inspiration
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. You may give any one player in your team an extra 
=MVP award, increasing the number of Star Player points the player has by 5. If this takes the player up a level you may take 
=the Star Player roll before the match starts.
Extra Training
=You can use this card in one of two ways: 1. You may use this card at any time in exactly the same way as a Team re-roll 
=counter. 2. You may play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. It allows you to buy an extra 
=Team re-roll counter which you may keep permanently, so long as you have the money in your treasury to pay for it. If you 
=buy the extra Team re-roll, then update your team roster accordingly.

Injured in Practise
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. One randomly selected player on the opposing team 
=is seriously injured during practice. Roll on the Serious Injury Table to see what injury they suffered. Note that the 
=player will not be able to play in this game because any serious injury causes a player to miss the next match.
=
=Notes: This is a SI (minimum of miss next game), but the game missed is the current game. You may use an apothecary on this 
=player, but then your apoth will be unavailable for the next match. This casualty does not count towards your Team 
=Casualties for this game.
The Big Match
=You may play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. If you decide to play it then the match is 
=being televised by the Broadcast Networks. The increased publicity means that both teams may add +3 to the dice roll on the 
=Fan Factor Table at the end of the match, and that both teams roll two dice and add them together to work out their 
=winnings.
=
=Notes: This counts as a part of your winnings.
Biased Referee
=You may play this card at any time. The referee is biased towards your team. Roll a dice each time he awards any penalties 
=against your team, or sends off a player for using a secret weapon. On a roll of 4+ he turns a blind eye to the infringement 
=of the rules and the penalty is negated. What is more, he will keep an eagle eye on the opposing team, so if one of their 
=players uses a secret weapon he is automatically sent off after a touchdown is scored. The effect of this card is cancelled 
=if the fans decide to 'Get the Ref' (even if it is your own fans who get him).
Charity Match
=Play this card at the end of the match, when you roll on the Fan Factor Table. Your team plays a charity match for the local 
=orphanage. The great publicity you receive for this kind act increases your fan factor by +1 point in addition to any 
=modification you may roll on the Fan Factor Table.
The Chuck
=You may play this card at any time. Your fans put on an awesome demonstration of 'The Chuck', lifting your team and 
=inspiring the players. Roll a dice and halve the score, rounding fractions up (i.e. 1-2=1; 3-4=2; 5-6=3). The result is the 
=number of expended Team Re-roll counters you may take back immediately.
Press-Gang
=You must play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. One randomly selected player on the 
=opposing team is kidnapped by a press gang from the Empire's navy. Roll a dice at half time to see when the player returns: 
=1-2= Escapes and returns in time for the second half; 3-4= Escapes and returns at the end of the match; 5-6= Forced to serve 
=as a slave on an Empire War Galley. He must miss the rest of this match and all of the next one too.
Heroic Effort
=Play this card when a player suffers an injury. Instead of rolling on the Injury Table, leave the player standing up. If he 
=was holding the ball he hangs onto it too! At the end of the drive the player collapses as the effects of the injury catch 
=up with him. Roll one dice and add +6 to the score, then look up the total on the Injury Table to see what injury the player 
=suffered. If the player suffers another injury during the drive, it affects him normally, and in addition to the effects of 
=the injury he ignored.
=
=Notes: Due to how Online rolls are made, you may use this card even after you see the result of the armor/injury roll.
Unsportmanlike Conduct
=Play this card just after the opposing team has scored a touchdown. The opposing player that scored the touchdown is sent 
=off by the referee for taunting your fans, and must miss the rest of the match.
That makes me mad!
=You may play this card when the opposing coach states that he is going to foul one of your players, before the armor roll 
=for the foul is made. The player being attacked is so incensed by the foul that he leaps up and smashes the player making 
=the foul to the ground. Stand the player being fouled up, place his attacker prone, and make an armor roll to see if the 
=attacker is injured.
Inspired Play
=You may play this card when one of your players takes an action. For that one action you do not have to roll a single dice, 
=because everything the player attempts to do that involves a dice roll works automatically! For example, if he attempts to 
=pick up the gall he will do so automatically, if he makes a block he will knock the opposing player over automatically, and 
=so on. Note that this ability will not apply to Armor rolls or injury rolls you make for players knocked over by the 
=inspired player!
=
=Notes: EVERYTHING works for one action. For example: You dodge thru 3 tackle zones to pick up the ball, then dodge back thru 
=the 3 tackle zones to throw a long bomb to a waiting player - without rolling ANY dice.
A Large Donation
=You may play this card at the end of the match, when you or your opponent is about to collect the winnings for the match. 
=The card can be played on either team. Whichever team it is played on donates all of their winnings to a deserving charity. 
=So impressed are the team's fans by this gesture that the team's fan factor goes up by 1 point.
=
=Notes: This takes away all your winnings, no matter the source.
That Boy's Got Talent
=You may play this card whenever the fans throw the ball back in, throw a rock at a player, or invade the field. You spot a 
=fan in the crowd who displays great natural athletic ability and would make a great BloodBowl player. You sign him on 
=straight away, and he is do eager to play that he joins your team without demanding the usual fee! You may immediately add 
=another player from your team list to your roster for free. You are free to choose any player from your team list.
=
=Notes: You are still limited by position limits (no having 3 or more mummies on the undead team for example).
Burst Ball
=You may play this card at any time. With a loud 'pop!' the ball bursts and deflates. Play stops immediately and the team 
=that kicked off last must kick-off again (any turns that have been used since the last kick-off are still lost).
Heroic Leap
=You may play this card at any time. It allows one player on your team to make one leap, just as if he had the Leap skill.
=
=Notes: This only adds the leap skill to the player, so it still takes 2 MA to do and you must make a landing roll.
Away Fans Banned!
=You may play this card at the start of the match, before the ball is kicked off. The fans belonging to the other team have 
=been banned from attending this match after the riots which broke out after their last game. No opposing fans turn up, but 
=the gate is worked out as normal because so many more of your own fans turn up to watch the match. Count the opposing team 
=as having a fan factor of '0' for the match.
Hall of Fame
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. Amid much publicity the player in your team with 
=the most Star Player points is admitted to the Hall of Fame. The resulting press coverage means that the popularity of the 
=team is increased. Raise the team's fan factor by 1 point to reflect this.
=
=Notes: You don't get to pick who this goes to unless you have 2 (or more) players leading your team in SPP's.
Blitzkrieg!
=You may play this card at any time. It allows a second player to make a Blitz action, even though one player has already 
=taken a Blitz action in the same turn.
=
=Notes: This does not let the same player make the extra blitz--remember, only ONE action per turn per player (barring 
=special play cards).
Snack Break
=You may play this card at any time. Nominate one player on the opposing team who is within 1 or 2 squares of the sidelines. 
=This player has taken the opportunity to grab a quick bite to eat, and is in the process of gulping down a McMurty burger he 
=has bought from a vendor in the stalls. He loses his tackle zone for the rest of the turn.
Get'em Lads!
=You may play this card when a player in your team is badly hurt, seriously injured or killed by a player from the opposing 
=team. Your players go berserk and smash into the other team. From now until the end of your next turn all of your players 
=count as having a Strength 1 point higher than normal and the Mighty Blow skill.
Crazy Referee!
=Play this card if the opposing team's fans attempt to 'Get the Ref' during the match. The referee turns out to be a 
=half-crazed ex-BloodBowl player who is perfectly capable of looking after himself. He easily beats off the attacking fans, 
=and is so angered by the attack that he chases the rest of them out of the stadium. The opposing team's fan factor is 
=reduced to 0 for the rest of the match.
Half Time Team Talk
=You may play this card at half time. Your half time team talk inspires your team. Roll a dice and halve the score rounding 
=fractions up (i.e. 1-2=1; 3-4=2; 5-6=3). The result is the number of extra Team Re-roll counters you may take to use in the 
=second half.
Is It a TD?
=You may play this card when an opposing player scores a touchdown. The ref's line of sight is blocked, and he does not award 
=a touchdown straight away. The opposing team turn ends as normal, but then you are allowed to take one bonus Blitz action 
=with one player. If this results in the scoring player being knocked over, dropping the ball, being pushed our of the End 
=Zone then the referee does not award a touchdown any you may carry on to hour next team turn (and the player who took the 
=bonus action gets another go!). Otherwise the referee awards the touchdown as normal.
Flu Bug
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. The opposing team is ravaged by a nasty strain of 
='flu. Roll a dice and halve the score rounding up (i.e. 1-2=1; 3-4=2; 5-6=3). The result is the number of randomly selected 
=players from the opposing team that must miss the match.
=
=Notes: The striken players will NOT be able to earn MVP's at the end of the game.
This Will Hurt a Bit...
=You may play this card at any time on a player from your team who has been KO'd, Badly Hurt or Seriously Injured. The 
=player's shoulder was dislocated, but has helpfully been 'popped' back into place by an assistant coach. After a minute or 
=two the player's screams subside, and you may move him from the Dead & Injured Players box to the Reserves box.
=
=Notes: You can play this card at any time AFTER the player has gone to the KO/Injured box.
I Am the Greatest!
=You may play this card just after a touchdown has been scored by either team. Two players in the opposing team become 
=involved in an acrimonious argument about the touchdown. You may choose the two players involved. The two players refuse to 
=be on the pitch at the same time for the rest of the match. The opposing coach may only have one of the players involved in 
=the argument on the field at a time.
Player Strike
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. The players on the opposing team refuse to take 
=part in the match unless they are paid more money. The opposing coach must pay them a number of gold pieces equal to the sum 
=of two dice x 10,000 gold pieces, or all of the money in his treasury, whichever is less.
=
=Notes: If you have no money in the treasury, the players have pity on you and play anyway.
Duh, Where Am I?
=You may play this card when an opposing player is knocked over and passes an Armor roll. Although the opposing player is not 
=seriously hurt, they have suffered one blow too many to their head and they become momentarily confused. From now on until 
=the next touchdown is scored (or a half ends) the opposing player is treated as being a player in your team, (i.e. he takes 
=actions during your team turn and you may decide what he does).
=
=Notes: If the Armor is NOT broken (ie, you roll a modidfied 8 or less against AV8), then you may use this card. You MAY 
=stand the player up on the same turn you use this card, since he did not fall down when he was a member of your team. The 
=player gains no SPP'S while 'playing' for your team, nor may he score a TD for you (the referee still knows which team he is 
=on), but if you aren't careful, he could score a TD for your opponent :)
A Better Offer
=You must play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. One of the opposing coaching staff (you 
=may choose which) has been made an offer by an opposing team, and will leave unless the team can beat it. In order to keep 
=his staff member the opposing must pay out a number of gold pieces equal to the cost for hiring them plus the roll of one 
=dice x 10,000.
=
=Notes: Coaching staff: Head Coach, Assistant Coaches, Cheerleaders, Apothecary, and Wizards (specialist wizzards). If you 
=use it on the Head Coach, the cost is just 1d6x10k, but if they don't pay then that team cannot argue calls for the rest of 
=the game, also Undead players would not be able to regenerate without the Head Coach/Necromancer (excepting Vampires).
Bankruptcy!
=Play this card at the end of the match when the opposing coach tries to collect his winnings. The opposing team has 
=unexpectedly gone bankrupt after some corrupt dealing by the board of directors. The team loses all of their winnings for 
=this match, and also have any money in the treasury wiped out as well.
=
=Notes: This takes away all your treasury and/or winnings, no matter the source.
Number One With a Bullet!
=Play this card at the end of the match when you collect your winnings. One of the players in your team has revealed until 
=now hidden talents as a singer/song writer (decide randomly which player it is). His performance of his newly written team 
=song before the match is a smash hit and sales of the song sheet go very well indeed. For every 10,000 fans that turned up 
=for the match, you receive an extra 10,000 gps winnings.
=
=Notes: This counts as part of your winnings.
Under Scrutiny
=Play this card if your opponent declares that they are going to make a foul, or if they attempt to bring a secret weapon 
=onto the field. The opposing team is being very closely observed by NAF officials who have heard rumors of underhand tactics 
=being used by the team. The opposing coach may not make any fouls or use any secret weapons during the match.
Merchandising
=Play this card at the end of the match when you collect your winnings. The sale of T-shirts and baseball caps with your 
=team's logo has reached record proportions. You receive a bonus to your winnings equal to your team's fan factor x 10,000 
=gps.
=
=Notes: This counts as part of your winnings.
Woof Woof!
=You may play this card when the ball is lying on the ground in an empty square. A stray dog leaps onto the field, and before 
=anyone can stop him he grabs the ball and runs off with it! You may immediately move the ball a number of squares equal to 
=the roll of two dice added together, representing the dog running around the field with the ball. It may not enter a square 
=occupied by a player or leave the field, but it may ignore tackle zones as it moves. Once he has finished moving the ball, 
=the dog drops the ball and it bounces 1 square. The dog then scampers off the field never to be seen again!
It Wasn't Me!
=You may play this card at any time. One randomly selected player on the opposing team is arrested for a minor crime and must 
=miss the rest of the match. If the player is on the field then remove him immediately (the ball scatters once from his 
=square if he was carrying it). The opposing coach may get him out of prison at the end of the match by paying his bail of 
=50,000 gold pieces. If he will not or cannot then the player will stay in jail and continue to miss matches until the bail 
=is paid.
=
=Notes: Until you pay to get him out, or fire the player, the player will count against your roster limits. If you retire the 
=player, you cannot make him an assistant coach UNLESS you pay the 50k fine.
Doom and Gloom
=You may play this card at any time. The opposing team is feeling uninspired and depressed, and doesn't play with their 
=customary flair. They may not use any Team Re-rolls for the rest of the half.
=
=Notes: This does not remove the RR's, so you could use them in OT.
Special Offer
=Play this card at the end of the match, after you have collected your winnings. It allows you to buy a player, including a 
=Star Player, at half the normal cost. If you do not buy the player now then you miss the opportunity - you cannot wait for a 
=few matches until you have enough money in the treasury!
=
=Notes: This card can only be used for PLAYERS, not coaching staff. You cannot use this card to get Free Agents.
Peaked
=You may play this card at any time. Nominate a player on the opposing team. That player has 'peaked' and cannot earn any 
=more Star Player points ever again. The opposing coach should note that the player has peaked on his team roster.
=
=Notes: The number of SPP's the player has is still used to determine TR, however, the player can never gain any more SPP's.
EndSet

{The Grab Bag cardset is initially disabled. Remove the { to enable it.
{CardSet=Grab Bag,GB,$00FFFF
Backfire
=You may play this card just after an opposing Wizard has cast any spell. The Wizard has been casting a lot of spells lately, and a backload of magical energy comes pouring out of him! The spell goes off as normal, but the Wizard is struck with the powerful backlash. Roll a dice to determine the effects: 1-3 = Badly Shaken, must miss the rest of the match, 4-5 = Seriously Injured, must miss the rest of this match and the next one, 6 = dead, dead, DEAD!
Bloodweiser Time
=You may play this card before any kick-off takes place, but after the two teams have set up. It seems that one of the alcohol vendors has wandered a bit too close to the dugout, and the opposing team is now drunk! All opponents suffer a -1 penalty on any roll made on the Agility Table. The effects of this card last until a touchdown is scored or the half ends.
Brain Trust
=Place this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. Renowned Orc shaman 'Snortin' Louie' is in town today, and several eggheads in his entourage become intensely interested in this fascinating game called 'Blood Bowl'. Roll a dice. The result is the number of Assistant Coaches you may add to your team immediately.
Brass Knuckles Day
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. The first 50,000 fans through the gate get their own brass knuckles, complete with official team logos! For the rest of the match, all injury rolls are made at +1 when a player is pushed off the pitch into the crowd.
Bribe The Announcer
=Play this card at the end of the match when you collect your MVP awards. You have bribed the announcer to call the game as you see it, and may assign your awards however you want (so long as it's legal!)
Butterfingers
=Play this card whenever an opponent attempts to pick up or catch the ball (this includes taking a handoff). The player simply can't seem to find the handle! He automatically fails the dice roll, and the ball will scatter one square.
C'mon, Already!
=You may play this card whenever an opposing player could score without rolling any dice, but the opposing coach instead declares his turn over, or performs an action with any other player instead of scoring immediately. The fans want their touchdown now, and one of them pelts the ball carrier with a rock in frustration! Place the ball carrier prone, and roll for the effects of the injury straight away.
Clairvoyance
=You may play this card at any time. After a successful night sharking cards at a nearby tavern, you have placed a local seer in your debt, and today you settle the score! Your opponent must play the game with all his Special Play Cards face-up and in full view.
Cup-a-joe
=Play this card on any player in your team just before any kickoff. The player has gone light on the fruit punch, and heavy on the coffee! He may stand up for free at the start of any action, just as if he had the Jump Up skill. He also gains the Frenzy skill, but any attempt to handle the ball will fail automatically, there is no need to roll the dice. The effects of this card last until a touchdown is scored or the half ends.
Did Somebody Say McMurthy's?
=Play this card immediately after a touchdown has been scored. McMurty's is having a special on burgers today. Being the kind-hearted coach you are, you have plastered this news all over your opponent's dugout. Roll a dice. The result is the number of randomly selected players from the opposing team that must miss the next kickoff, as they are waiting in line for their burgers! Place the players in the Reserves box, they may not take the field this drive.
Extra Training
=You can use this card in one of two ways: 1. You may use this card at any time in exactly the same way as a Team re-roll counter. 2. You may play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. It allows you to buy an extra Team re-roll counter which you may keep permanently, so long as you have the money in your treasury to pay for it. If you buy the extra Team re-roll, then update your team roster accordingly.
False Start
=You may play this card after any roll has been made on the kickoff table, but before the result is applied. The opposing team has started before the whistle! The referee stops and then restarts play immediately. Leave the teams in the same setups, and roll on the kickoff table a second time.
Fizzle
=You may play this card when your opponent casts a spell or attempts to use a Magic Item. Something has gone terribly wrong and the magic has fizzled out. The spell or card is wasted, and has no effect.
Gimme That!
=You may play this card after one of your players has pushed an opponent who is holding the ball without knocking him over. Your player has waited all game to show what he can do, and he wants that ball NOW! The opposing ball carrier automatically drops the ball. What's more, he drops it right into the hands of your player, who catches it automatically!
Gotta Be The Shoes
=You may play this card after both teams have set up, but before the ball is kicked off. One randomly selected player from your team has signed a one-off endorsement contract with Orcidas. For every SPP earned by that player this game, your team gains 10,000 Gold Crowns when you collect your winnings at the end of the match.
Half Time Tea Talk
=You may play this card at halftime. After a stern talking-to from their coach, your players have learned a few things from the first half of action! Add up any Star Player Points from the first half gained by your players immediately. If this takes any player up a level you may take the Star Player roll before the second half starts, and may use the new skill(s) in the second half.
I'll Take That!
=You may play this card when an opposing player who is holding the ball enters a square adjacent to one of his own players. That player has been itching to show his coach how great he is, and takes the ball! This counts as the team's handoff for the turn, but it is automatically successful, there is no need to roll the dice.
I've Created A Monster!
=You may play this card when a player in your team is knocked out by a player from the opposing team. Instead of placing him in the KO box, leave the player on the field, face up. The devastating hit has unleashed his hidden potential! The player gets a +1 bonus to all stats (MA, ST, AG, and AV). The effects of this card last until a touchdown is scored or the half ends.
I've Got My Eye On You
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. An opponent has made some nasty remarks about a player's mother. Little does he know, however, that this woman is none other than today's referee! For the rest of the match, the ref is biased against the opposing team. All opposing Fouls result in the fouler being ejected unless the fouling player rolls doubles on the armor roll, and any Secret Weapons automatically fail their penalty rolls. The effect of this card is canceled if the fans decide to 'Get The Ref' (even if it is your own fans who get him!).
Instant Replay
=You may play this card after any roll made by the opposing coach. The coach must reroll the dice and accept the new result in place of the old, even if he has already used a skill or team reroll to do so! Note that this is the only time a dice roll may be rerolled more than once.
Johnny Waterboy
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. You have hired the famous Johnny Waterboy for this game, and his special smelling salts work wonders on your players! For the rest of the match, all knocked out players on your team recover on a roll of 2+ instead of the usual 4+.
Keeper
=Play this card immediately after you have played any other Special Play Card. You may keep the card, and use it again later in the match!
Last Ditch Effort
=You may play this card when a player on your team passes the ball. The player may throw the ball to any square on the field, just as if he had the Hail Mary Pass skill.
Magic Flux
=Play this card after you have taken all your Special Play Cards for the match. The forces of Chaos are running strong at today's game! Trade this card in for a Magic Item card, even if you have already taken one. Note that this is the only way in which a team is allowed to pick two Magic Items in the pre-game sequence.
Miraculous Recovery
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. The team apothecary said it couldn't be done,but it has! Remove any one permanent injury from the player of your choice.
Mother, May I?
=You may play this card at the start of the match, before the ball has been kicked off. Nominate a player from the opposing team. That player's mother is attending today's game, and she has warned him that he had better play nice with the other boys, or else! All injury rolls made by that player automatically result in 'Stunned,' there is no need to roll the dice.
NotSoSecret Weapon
=Play this card at any kickoff, after both teams have set up. One of your players manages to smuggle a two-handed greatsword onto the pitch while the ref has his back turned. Treat this player as if he has a running chainsaw, but he does not need to make a roll to start his weapon. The effects of this card last until a touchdown is scored or the half ends, after which the referee finally catches up with this maniac, and the player is ejected automatically.
Palmed Coin
=Play this card before any coin toss. Your team captain has sneakily replaced the usual coin with a double-headed eagle! You win the coin toss automatically, there is no need to flip the coin.
Poor Bodily Hygiene
=You may play this card at any kickoff, before either team has set up. Nominate a player from the opposing team. This player is suffering from some extremely bad body odor, and his team-mates have forced him to take an early shower! The player must remain in the Reserves box until a touchdown is scored or the half ends.
Raindancer
=While traveling between matches, you encounter a wandering wizard who gives you this scroll. Play this card at the start of any team turn. The scroll's magic allows you to choose the weather from the options on the weather table immediately!
Revenant
=You may play this card immediately after one of your players has been killed. The player's body has thrown in the towel, but his mind hasn't! Leave the player on the field, face up. Treat the player as normal for the rest of the game, but he will come back from any injury automatically just before the next kickoff. At the end of the match the player gives up the ghost, and you must remove him from your roster permanently.
Ringer
=You may play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. Nominate a player on your team. That player has taken the day off, and has hired a lookalike to play in his place. The substitute player has the stats of any rookie player from your team roster. Note that this is the only way your team can violate the usual limits on position players.
Stolen Playbook
=You may play this card when any player on your team makes a Star Player roll. The player has stolen the opponent's play book, and has studied it carefully at every opportunity. Because of his increased understanding of the game, you do not need to roll for a new skill. Instead, the player may gain a new skill as if he had rolled a double on the Star Player table.
Stop Faking It!
=You may play this card when one of your players has been caught fouling, but failed to penetrate armor. The referee comes running over to eject the fouler, but when he sees the victim on the ground, moaning in pain, he realizes no foul has been committed at all. The 'victim' is just faking it, so he ejects the victim instead!
That Babe's Got Talent!
=Play this card at the start of the match, before either team has set up. Your team visits a local tavern the night before the game. One of the exotic dancers displays her, umm, 'talents,' and your players leave her a very generous tip. She and a couple of her friends decide to join your team. Roll a dice. The result is the number of Cheerleaders you may add to your team immediately.
We'z Got Dis One In Da Bag
=Play this card just after the opposing team has scored a touchdown which gives them the lead. The other team is so confident they have the game won, they send out the second string. For the ensuing kickoff, your opponent may only set up the 11 players on his team with the fewest Star Player Points.
You Look Familiar
=You may play this card when an opposing player declares a foul while standing next to a prone team-mate. The fouler has gotten a little confused, and fouls his team-mate instead! Your players may assist the fouler.
