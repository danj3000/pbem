= stuff really doesn't agree with him.  Roll another D6 after the D6 for the MA
= increase, if the second D6 roll is not equal to or greater than the first,
= make an immediate injury roll for the Clanrat.  Treat Stunned results as
= Knocked Out.
AERO-ANVIL 70X3
=Play at the beginning of your opponent's turn. A clanrat is hovering over
= the stadium dangling from a balloon and carrying an anvil. Pick a target
= square, roll for scatter 3 times. The anvil lands in this final square. 
= Anyone hit by the anvil is knocked over (make normal armour and injury rolls).
Beware of Falling Boulders
=Play at the beginning of your opponent's turn. A clanrat sits atop a nearby
= mountain waiting to free a precarious boulder from it's home high above the
= stadium. Pick a target square, roll for scatter 5 times. The boulder
= lands in this final square. Anyone hit by the boulder must make an injury
= roll. Anyone adjacent to the target square is knocked over (make armour and
= injury rolls as normal).
Exploding Boomerang
=Play during your turn at any time during a Clanrat's action. The active clanrat
= throws the exploding boomerang as if it were a football but with a -1 penalty
= since boomerangs are difficult to throw.  Also because of the way boomerangs
= have to be thrown, the boomerang cannot be thrown as a quick pass. If the
= throw is accurate, it explodes in the target square, knocking over any player
= therein (armour and injury rolls as normal). If the throw is inaccurate or
= fumbles, it comes back and explodes in the thrower's square knocking him down
= instead. This does not count as the team's pass action for the turn.
Exploding Football
=Play during your turn at any time during a Clanrat's action. A devious trick,
= the active clanrat lights the fuse and tosses to an opposing player who will
= attempt to catch it thinking it's the real ball. After the fuse is lit, roll a
= D6, on a 1 or 2, the Clanrat wasn't quick enough and the ball explodes in his
= hands.  Otherwise throw the exploding football using normal passing rules. Of
= course, the other clanrats think it is as well and any who are able will try
= to intercept it. If no one catches the ball it will scatter once and then
= explode. Any player in the square where the ball explodes (either by catch or
= scatter) is knocked  over (make armour and injury rolls as normal).  This does
= not count as the team's pass action for the turn.  If the pass is fumbled, it
= explodes in the same square as the throwing Clanrat.  The exploding football
= may not be thrown to the current ball carrier as they know its not the real
= football.
Exploding Explosives
=Play during your turn at any time during a Clanrat's action. The active clanrat
= stayed out late buying explosives on the pitch. Select a target player and
= roll a d6. On a 1-3: the detonator blows up on the active clanrat instead of
= the dynamite, on a 4-5: scatter three times from the opposing players square
= to see where it blows up as the placement of the explosives was a little off. 
= On a 6, the dynamite goes off on the square of the target player. Any player
= on the exploding end rolls for injury (no armour roll).
Spring-Loaded Boxing Glove
=Play during your turn immediately after a player's declared action. The active 
= Clanrat may make a block/blitz as though he had a ST of 5 and the skill mighty
= blow this turn. However, if any of the blocking dice come up Skull, then the
= Clanrat must roll for injury straight away regardless of which blocking die is
= used against the target.  (ie the best dice roll may be used against the
= opponent, but if any dice roll is a skull then the Clanrat is knocked down
= also with a Mighty Blow modifier)
The Paint Gag
=Play at the beginning of your opponent's turn. An industrious clanrat has
= stretched a canvas across the field and painted it to look like the endzone.
= Pick any row of squares within d6 paces of the opponent's endzone. The
= opponent believes this to be the actual endzone and will not go past this
= line this turn. The trick is revealed at the end of the turn, however, and
= the opposing team may play as normal next turn. At the end of the turn, the
= closest Clanrat to the Paint Gag row (Clanrats closer to the opposing end zone
= than the Paint Gag row don't count) is blocked by the big ogre player who
= comes striding out of the picture (automatic injury roll with +1 modifier,
= Stunned results are treated as Knocked Out.)
Bed Springs
=Play during your turn immediately after a player's declared action. The active
= clanrat gains the Leap skill and may go for it up to 4 squares for this turn
= only.  Leap may be used multiple times during this turn by this player.
PitchWall 5000
=Play at the beginning of your opponent's turn. The clanrats placed a 
= spring-loaded steel wall beneath the pitch last night. For an opposing player
= on the clanrat's half of the pitch, the rats may attempt to trigger the wall.
= Roll d6. On a 1-2, the wall fires a little off and catches a pursuing
= clanrat instead, the nearest clanrat in hit by the wall.  On a 3-4, the
= Clanrat is too slow activating the wall.  Scatter three times from the target
= square to see what square it pops up in.  On a 5-6, the wall pops up in the
= target square.  If any Axme player is hit by the wall, he is knocked
= down by the wall (armour/injury rolls).  An opponent effected will just run
= into the wall and be knocked loopy by the impact, but stays on his feet.
= The player's movement will be zero for this turn and while he cannot block
= or pick up, catch, or pass the ball this turn, he can still handoff the ball
= with a -1 modifier.
Earthquake Pills
=Play during your turn immediately after a player's declared action. The active
= clanrat gains Dauntless and Frenzy for the rest of his action, but must roll
= for injury when his action is complete.
Picnic Ants
=Play at the beginning of your opponent's turn. A sneaky clanrat has devised
= a plan to release his specially-trained Lustrian ants in the opponent's
= dugout. Roll a die, on a 1, 2, or 3, the clanrat gets his dugouts confused
= and releases them in the Clan Axme dugout by mistake, otherwise, they are
= on target. The affected team is so busy jumping about trying to brush off
= the little buggers that they are not able to do important things like coach
= the game! Thus, the team is not allowed to use any member of their coaching
= staff or use any team re-rolls for the rest of the drive. By the next
= kickoff, the ants have been stomped and slapped and poisoned into submission.
Tornado Seeds
=Play during your turn at any time during a Clanrat's action. Just add water and
= watch the fun! A tornado is released on the pitch from a target spot next to
= the active Axme clanrat. The tornado will move 2d6 squares, then dissipate.
= Use the scatter template to determine which direction the tornado will move.
= It moves in a straight line for all 2d6 squares. If the tornado enters a
= square occupied by a player, that player receives a ST 5 block (no assists
= either side). The tornado ignores any effects of the blocking die and 
= continues to move until its movement is expended.  The Tornado Seeds must be
= thrown into an empty square.
Referee Disguise
=Play during your turn immediately after a player's declared action. This
= industrious clanrat has come onto the pitch wearing a referee disguise. The
= other team falls for his trick and ignores him. The active clanrat need not
= make any dodge rolls to move through enemy tackle zones for this turn.
= Unfortunately, referees do not appreciate this trick at all.  So every square
= the Clanrat tries to move requires a 2+ (GFI squares thus require two 2+
= rolls), failure means that he has been ejected immediately by a wary referee.
= The referee disguise uses a water-based paint and a sudden rainstorm washes
= away his disguise at the end of the turn, attracting a lot more attention from
= the real referee and getting him ejected  from the game on a roll of 1, 2, or
= 3.  Note: Resolve does not work to return a Clanrat from being ejected from
= the game.
The Old Reliable Hidden Hole in the Ground
=Play at the beginning of your opponent's turn. The Clanrats stayed up late
= digging a few pit traps beneath the pitch, then covered them with a thin paper
= cover and retired to their hole to dream of falling orcs. Play this card on
= any opposing player. That player has just ventured onto one of the concealed
= holes. Roll a die. On a roll of 4+, the player falls into the pit and cannot
= climb out until the next kickoff (place the player in the reserves box, if 
= he was holding the ball, the opposing coach may scatter the ball twice in
= the directions of his choice to represent the player pitching the ball to his
= mates as he falls.) On a roll of 1-3, the paper did not break and the closest
= Clanrat runs over in disbelief, leaping upon the cover in frustration, and 
= breaks through. The Clanrat is unavailable until the next drive.
Female Ork Disguise
=Play during your turn immediately after a player's declared action. A crafty
= clanrat (who is not holding the ball) has taken to the pitch wearing a
= disguise that draws the basal attention of the other team quite effectively.
= The active clanrat's movement is halved (rounded down) with no GFIs allowed
= (its difficult to do all that hip swaying), but all adjacent opposing players
= to this active clanrat at any point during his movement lose their tackle 
= zone for the turn. However, the disguise is not fastened on all that well and 
= will fall off at the end of the turn, drawing the ire of the embarrassed 
= enemy, and  thus any hits against the masquerading clanrat will have the
= effects of the +1 ST, Mighty Blow, and Frenzy skills next turn (must be during
= the same drive.)
Super-Rat Costume
=Play during your turn immediately after a player's declared action. This
= clanrat has taken the field in the guise of skaven comic-book hero super rat.
= Convinced he possess the superabilities of the hero, the active clanrat may
= add +1 to each of his attributes for the rest of the turn and gains the skills
= Mighty Blow and Leap. If the clanrat is knocked down in this turn by any
= means, however, his confidence is so shaken he automatically fails his armour
= roll and Stunned injury results are treated as Knocked Out.
The Axme Board-O-Fun See-Saw
=Play during your turn at any time. Choose any two clanrats within 2 squares of
= one another. Designate one as the "weight" and the other as the "jumper" and
= roll a d6. On a 1-2, the scheme backfires and the weight is flung d6 squares
= toward the Axme endzone. On a roll of 3-4, nothing particularly eventful
= happens as the laws of gravity prevail. On a roll of 5-6, the jumper is hurled
= 2d6 squares toward the opponent's endzone. Use the normal rules for landing
= when thrown by a teammate for flung clanrats. Assume the pass is inaccurate.
= Passing over the appropriate endzone in the air counts as a TD as it is assumed
= that the Clanrat touched down in the endzone for a brief second before skipping
= off the pitch into the crowd.  If the Clanrat goes into the crowd, then will 
= suffer two injury rolls ... one for the crash landing and one for
= the crowd.  Use whichever results injuries the Clanrat the most.
Junior Size Outboard Steam Roller
=Play during your turn immediately after a player's declared action. A
= mechanically-inclined clanrat has built this fiendish weapon and takes to the
= pitch with it. For the length of his action, he loses his normal skills and
= stats is assumed to be (4/6/1/7 with multiple block and dirty player).
= Because this thing is not nearly as well built as a Deathroller, the Clanrat
= will still need to dodge to leave tackle zones. At the end of the turn, the
= unstable steam engine explodes injuring the clanrat.  Treat Stunned results as
= Knocked Out.
Big Magnet
=Play during your turn at any time during a Clanrat's action. A devious Clanrat
= has lined the ball with iron pellets and snuck a huge magnet onto the field.
= The active Clanrat may use the magnet and any point during his action Roll a
= d6. On a 1, the magnet locks onto one of the support beams in the grandstands
= (roll for injury from the crowd). The clanrat flies off into the crowd. On a
= roll of 2, the magnet attunes to a particular spot on the pitch. The clanrat
= will be pulled 1d6 squares in a random direction (any players in the way will
= be pushed out of the way by the magnetized clanrat into an adjacent square of
= the player's coach's choice). If the die comes up a 3 or a 4, nothing happens.
= On a roll of 5, the ball will move 1d6 squares in the direction of the clanrat
= if held by a player (dragging the opposing player with the ball), or 2d6
= squares if it is loose. On a result of 6, the ball flings through the air by
= itself and clings firmly to the magnet, the Clanrat gains possession of the
= ball.
Portable Hole
=Play during your turn at any time during a Clanrat's action.  Move the active
= clanrat to any unoccupied square within d6 squares, ignoring all obstructions
= and tacklezones. If the die roll is a '6' the clanrat is lost in space and
= will miss the remainder of the game trying to find his way out.
Ballnet 5000
=Play during your opponent's turn when he declares a pass. The closest Clanrat
= (up to a maximum of 3 squares away) on the field to the catcher may be
= selected to deploy the infamous Ballnet 5000. Roll a die, on a 4+ the ball is
= intercepted by the clanrat (and the Clanrat gets the star player points for
= an interception). On a roll of 1-3, however, the clanrat gets trapped in the
= net and is placed in the Knocked Out box as it will take him a good while to
= sort himself out.
