HOW TO USE PICTURES FOR PLAYERS:

1) Go to the directory where your PBEMBBxx.EXE program is located.
2) Create a subdirectory 'roster'. 
3) Put the pictures you want to use in the subdirectory 'roster'. 
ALL PICTURES HAVE TO BE IN THIS SUBDIRECTORY. The tool looks for them over here.
  Please note that the version 2.3beta and later allow for the pictures to be
  organized in subdirectories.  So if your jpgs are in roster than the source
  would be for example: amazonblitzer.jpg ... if this was in an Amazon subdirectory
  under the 'roster' directory then the source would be: Amazon/amazonblitzer.jpg
4) Add the pictures in your team-html:
Open your team-html in NOTEPAD or a html-editor. Go to the bottom of your html-file
(usually just before the </BODY> and </HTML> tag).
Here you add the following:

Team Pictures
<IMG SRC="picture1.jpg">
<IMG SRC="picture2.jpg">
...  (as many pictures as you need)
Team Pictures End

You need to add a <IMG> tag for every player on your roster, in the same order as in
your roster. If you have an empty roster slot, add a picture for that as well! It
won't be used in the program, but you don't want to mess up the order of the next
pictures.
5) Save your team-html.
6) Start a new game, using the new team-html.
7) If you send the new game to your opponent, remember to send your player pictures
to him as well. He should put them in his 'roster' subdirectory. Of course you 
need to send the pictures only once, at the start of your game.

Other HTML extras:

TEAM LOGO SRC="picture1.jpg"

TEAM FIELD SRC="field1.jpg"

TEAM COLOR=######

Please note custom logos and fields MUST be stored in the /roster directory to work!
