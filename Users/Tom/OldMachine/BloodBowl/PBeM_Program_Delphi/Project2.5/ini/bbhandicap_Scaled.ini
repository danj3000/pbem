2 INTENSIVE TRAINING: One player is really psyched for this week’s match, and has been working very hard preparing for it. Pick a player on your team. He may take one extra skill to use for this match only, just as if he had rolled a New Skill result on the Star Player Table. 
3 SCUTT’S SCROLL OF WEATHER MAGIC: You have tricked a gullible Wizard into parting with a useful scroll. Once per game, at the start of either player’s turn, you can select a weather result – the weather will immediately change to that result and remain there until a Weather Change kickoff roll is made.
4 PALMED COIN: You automatically win the coin toss to start the game (do not flip the coin). 
5 TEAM ANTHEM: Add +3 to your Fan Factor for this game only. (this is automated in PBeM Tool already) 
6 EGGHEAD CONVENTION: A local inventor’s guild is sponsoring a convention in the city today.  Several of the attendees are big fans of your team, and are willing to assist your team in today’s match in exchange for getting to watch the game from the sidelines.  With their aid, your team will automatically win any Brilliant Coaching results on the Kickoff Table.
7 THAT BABE’S GOT TALENT! Your team visits the local tavern the night before the game. One of the exotic dancers displays her, umm, ‘talents,’ and your players leave her a generous tip. She and a few friends decide to hang out with your team for the day. You automatically win any Cheering Fans results on the Kickoff Table. 
8 WINDS OF CHANGE: Once during the game, you may change the Kick-Off result to a result either one above or one below it on the kick-off table. 

[Name: Dirty Tricks and Random Events --- Handicap Points Needed: 20]
1 MAGIC SPONGE: Your team has received a free magic sponge from the College of Wizards when they heard about this upcoming match. You may use the Magic Sponge once this game just like an Apothecary (even if your team normally doesn't have access to an apothecary). 
2 BAD HABITS: The opposing team loses D3 re-rolls for this match only. 
3 SMELLING SALTS: You make all rolls to move a player from the Knocked Out box to the Reserves box on a roll of 2 or better for this match.  (PBeM Tool automates this)
4 DUH, WHERE AM I?: One player (your choice) on the opposing team has been out all night on a bender, and isn’t really ready for the game. The Really Stupid rule that applies to Trolls applies to the player for this match only. (Right Click, Stats Change, Give the player Really Stupid)
5 IRON MAN: One player on your team (your choice) is determined to play hard for the whole game, no matter what the cost – in fact, he refuses to get injured! If an opposing player beats his Armour roll, he is only Stunned. (Right Click, Stats Change, Give the player Iron Man)
6 BUZZING!: One of your players (your choice) has gone heavy on the coffee in anticipation of today’s game. For this match only he gains the Jump Up trait and the Frenzy trait. 
7 KIDS GLOVES: One player (your choice) on the opposing team has the NAF questioning his tactics on how he has been racking up those injuries. He decides to go easy this game to reduce the scrunity on him. All injury rolls made against your team by this player from fouling or blocking will be treated as Stunned results. (Right Click, Stats Change, Give the player Pulled Punches)
8 EGO TRIP: One player (your choice) on the opposing team has developed a real swelled head from his success. For this match, this player must move first every turn or not move at all ((Right Click, Stats Change, Give the player Greater Glory)

[Name: Desperate Measures --- Handicap Points Needed: 40]
1 ASSASSIN: Your team has hired an assassin to take out one of the other team’s top guns. Pick a player on the opposing team and roll a D6.  On a 1-4, the player is KO'd.  On a 5-6, the Assassin does a number on the player and he is Badly Hurt.  The opposing coach may use his Apothecary or Regenerate trait on this player, but an Apothecary used in this manner cannot be used later in the game.
2 I AM THE GREATEST!: The two players with the most SPPs on the opposing team refuse to be on the pitch at the same time for this match only. Only one may be set up on the field at the start of each drive. 
3 MORLEY’S REVENGE: The opposing team’s drinks have been spiked with a powerful laxative. D3 randomly selected opposing players have drunk the spiked drink, and must roll a D6 before every kick-off. On a roll of 1-3 they are otherwise engaged and may not take part in this drive. On a roll of 4-6 they may be set up normally. 
4 DOOM and GLOOM: Due to some cunningly planted rumors and smear campaigns, the opposing team comes into the game with some serious morale issues.  Roll a D6 for each re-roll the opposing team has; for each result other than 6, the opposing team loses a re-roll for the match. 
5 HEY, YOU!: You spot a talented (if crazy) fan in the stands, and he agrees to play for your team. The fan has MA6, ST4, AG3, AV7, and the Frenzy trait. The player leaves your team when the match ends. Note that you may add a 17th player to your team with this result. 
6 IN THE BAG!: The opposing team is feeling cocky about their chances of winning this match. They can only field the 11 worst available players on their team, based on SPPs (in case of ties, the team with the lower TR picks which is unable to play). This restriction stops for the rest of the match as soon as your team takes the lead.
7 RUNNING LATE: Agents in your employ manage to delay D3 randomly selected players on the opposing team for this inconvenient match. The players must miss the first half. 
8 DOCTOR IN THE HOUSE?: A huge apothecary convention is in town (which even attracts several Necromancers) and it turns out that a lot of them are fans of your team. For this match, your team treats all Deaths as Serious Injury-Miss Next Game; all Serious Injuries are treated as Badly Hurt; and all Badly Hurts are treated as Knocked Out. This effect is applied before you have to use your Apothecary.
